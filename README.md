# Intermittent Empty FlatList in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component intermittently renders an empty list even when the data has been successfully fetched from an API.  The issue appears to be related to the timing of asynchronous operations.

## Bug Description

A `FlatList` component in a React Native app fails to display fetched data. The data is successfully fetched from an external API, but the list remains empty. This behavior is not consistent, occurring randomly and making debugging difficult. 

## Solution

The solution involves careful handling of asynchronous operations and state updates using useEffect hook.  This ensures the FlatList is only updated after the data has fully loaded and processed.
